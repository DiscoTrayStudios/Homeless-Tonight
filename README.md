# Homeless-Tonight-
## What does our app do?

Our app is made up of screens split between two sides. When a user opens the app, they should immidiately see three button options: need shelter, domestic violence, resources, and a text button that says "I am a service provider". On the homeless side of the app, we have three main screens designed to allow homeless users to get access to different resources they need. On the service provider side, they have two main screens that allow the service providers to sign in and claim requests from the homeless users. There is also one screen shared between the two sides of the app: the messaging screen, allowing users and service providers to message each other in the app. 

## How does our app work?

The homeless users should be able to access the app as soon as they open it while the service provider users need to sign in. On the homeless side, the main home screen has three main options: navigation to the shelter, victim of domestic violence, and resources screen. the shelter screen allolows users to enter their name, location, and the type of shelter they need. The domestic violence screen allows users to directly call through the app, and the resources screen is divided into four categories: shelter, food, emergency supplies, and laundry. Each resources category has information of the respective organisazation.


## Who is the audience for our project?

The app is designed for homeless people to connect them with service providers in order to get resources such as food, water, shelter, etc.
